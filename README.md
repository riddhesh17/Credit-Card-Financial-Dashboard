## Introduction
The **Credit Card Financial Dashboard** is a comprehensive data analysis project designed to provide actionable insights into credit card transactions and customer behavior. Developed using Power BI and PostgreSQL, this dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for monitoring key metrics such as revenue, transaction volumes, customer demographics, and expenditure trends.

## Methodology
1. Extracted transaction data from a database using PostgreSQL queries to ensure real-time data synchronization.
2. Processed and analyzed the data to identify patterns and trends.
3. Designed interactive visualizations and dashboards in Power BI to present the insights effectively.
4. Integrated dynamic filtering and drill-through capabilities for detailed exploration.

## Technology Used
- **PostgreSQL**: Executed SQL queries for data retrieval and transformations, enabling real-time insights.
- **Power BI**: Developed interactive visualizations and connected to PostgreSQL for data integration.

## Elements Used in Power BI for Visualization
